// Client-router fingerprinting for inbound `/v1/*` traffic.
//
// Several AI-gateway products can themselves be pointed at this gateway. An
// operator may want to refuse a specific one per API key — the reason is
// usually commercial rather than security: a router that fans a paid key out
// to its own users, or one whose retry behaviour multiplies upstream load.
//
// This is a best-effort label, never a gate the rest of the system may rely on.
// A client that removes every header looks like a plain SDK caller, so the
// label is evidence for an operator, not a security boundary.
//
// Every signal here names its product literally. A "corroborating" tier was
// tried and removed on evidence: the candidate signals for it — the Claude Code
// system prompt, `x-anthropic-billing-header`, `x-claude-code-session-id` — are
// the *genuine* first-party client's own values, which is exactly what these
// routers imitate. Measured against captured traffic, those signals labelled a
// real Claude Code request as OmniRoute, so they are worse than no signal: they
// cannot separate the imitator from the imitated.
