/**
 * Per-installation identity ids, shared by the providers that stamp one on
 * their upstream requests (Claude, Codex, Grok).
 *
 * Three things went wrong when each provider owned this logic, and all three
 * are fixed here:
 *
 * 1. The id was written under `$HOME/.cloviela`. In the container the process
 *    drops to uid 10001 via `setpriv`, which does not change `HOME` — so it kept
 *    pointing at `/root` and every write failed with `EACCES`. The location is
 *    now a list of candidates tried in order, and `$HOME` is only one of them.
 *
 * 2. A failed write threw, and the caller let it escape into dispatch: a
 *    cosmetic telemetry identity took the whole provider offline. A failure to
 *    persist now degrades to an in-process id and a one-time warning.
 *
 * 3. Three copies of the same read/mkdir/open sequence had drifted apart. There
 *    is one now.
 *
 * The id is deliberately best-effort. It is an identity hint for the upstream,
 * not a credential: losing it changes how a machine is counted, never whether a
 * request can be served.
