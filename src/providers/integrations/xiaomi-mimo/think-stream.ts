/**
 * Splits inline thinking tags in the Xiaomi MiMo Studio SSE stream.
 *
 * Studio interleaves `<think>` or `<thinking>` spans with answer text and
 * NUL padding. Desktop uses the separate `reasoning_content` chat field,
 * so its standard OpenAI-compatible stream decoder does not use this splitter.
 *
 * The splitter is stateful because a tag can straddle two SSE frames: the
 * `<thi` of one chunk and the `nk>` of the next are one opening tag, and a
 * stateless regex would emit the fragment as text. It therefore holds back a
 * trailing run that could still become a tag until the next chunk settles it.
 *
 * Two further quirks are handled here rather than at each call site:
 * - NUL bytes (`\u0000`) are injected by the upstream between thought tokens;
 *   forwarded verbatim they break JSON encoders and terminal renderers.
 * - Text before an opening tag is the answer (some models answer first and
 *   reason afterwards), so it stays content; only the enclosed span becomes
 *   reasoning.
