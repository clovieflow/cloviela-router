/**
 * `conversationId` in the Studio bot-chat body selects which upstream chat the
 * turn continues, and the upstream keeps that chat's history server-side.
 * Minting a fresh id per dispatch made every turn a brand-new upstream
 * conversation, so a follow-up lost the thread and concurrent callers sharing
 * one provider account were indistinguishable.
 *
 * This store remembers one conversation per client chat, keyed by provider
 * account plus the inbound session identity, so a chat stays on its own thread
 * while other chats keep theirs. It also tracks which turns the upstream has
 * actually received, which is what lets a dispatch send only the new ones — the
 * bot endpoint rejects a `query` above ~50k characters, so replaying a long
 * history is what breaks a large context even though the model advertises a far
 * bigger window.
 *
 * What is recorded is the turns the upstream *received*, not the turns the
 * client sent: a query too long for the endpoint has its oldest turns dropped,
 * and those turns are not in the upstream conversation.
