/**
 * Kiro machine identity.
 *
 * The upstream binds a credential to the device it was first seen from, and a
 * credential that presents a different device on every request — or the same
 * device as every other account — reads as account sharing rather than as one
 * machine running one client. Two shapes in particular are worse than sending
 * nothing at all:
 *
 *  * a constant, because every account in every deployment then claims to be
 *    the same machine, and the constant is identical for every operator;
 *  * a per-request random value, because one account appears to move between
 *    devices on every call.
 *
 * So the identity is derived once per credential from material that is stable
 * for that credential and distinct between credentials, then frozen into the
 * account's `auth_state` so a refresh — which rotates the refresh token, and
 * with it any value derived from that token — cannot silently change it.
 *
 * The salts below are wire facts: they are what the observed client hashes.
 * They are deliberately different per credential family, because an API key and
 * a refresh token for the same account must not derive the same device id.
