/**
 * Resolves and validates an explicitly configured connection string.
 *
 * Postgres and Redis both read one URL variable, and both sit behind platforms
 * that may publish the connection under a different name or as discrete
 * host/user/password parts. The rules are identical, so they live here once:
 *
 * - An empty value counts as absent. A `${{ Service.VAR }}` reference to a
 *   service whose name does not match resolves to `""` rather than failing, and
 *   treating that as "configured" turns a one-word mistake into an unexplained
 *   connection error.
 * - Every candidate is validated the same way, so a malformed alternative is
 *   reported against the variable it came from instead of the primary name.
 * - Host and port must be explicit. No host is ever inferred — every value here
 *   was provided by the deployment.
