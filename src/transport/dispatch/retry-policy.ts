 * A provider-scoped 429, on a provider whose limits follow the egress address.
 *
 * Only then is the pool the thing that ran out: the upstream counted requests
 * from this address, so the next attempt must leave by a different one and
 * cooling this pool is the fix. `providerRateLimitIsIpScoped` holds that fact
 * per provider (see the metadata field) rather than inferring it from the
 * response — a 429 states which bucket was exhausted only in the provider's own
 * wording, and every account-keyed provider words it the same way.
 *
 * For an account-keyed provider the 429 belongs to the credential that was
 * dialed. The account health machine already records it and routes the next
 * request to a sibling, so cooling the pool as well only removed healthy
 * accounts from service: every account sharing that egress lost its route for
 * the cooldown window because one of them hit its own limit. A bare 429 with no
 * provider scope stays a request-level limit and never cools the pool.
 *
 * `providerId` is the caller's own candidate, not a field read off the error:
 * the in-stream error frames the protocol modules build carry no `providerId`
 * detail, so reading it from `details` would silently disable the IP-scoped
 * rule on exactly the streaming path it exists for.
 *
 * A type guard on `GatewayError`, so a caller that passes this check can hand
 * the same value to `flagPoolCooldown` without a second narrowing step.
