/**
 * Per-account egress rotation for the daily check-in ride-along.
 *
 * The check-in hits the provider's billing facade once per account per day.
 * Sending every account through the same direct egress gives them all one
 * source IP; some facades rate-limit or flag that shape. When network pools
 * are available, each account rotates to a different pool so the check-ins
 * spread across IPs. When there are fewer pools than accounts — or none at
 * all — the rotation simply wraps and repeats; a repeated IP is accepted, an
 * unattempted check-in is not.
 *
 * Pools are tenant-scoped, and quota sweep targets carry their tenant in
 * `tenantId`. A pool row with a null tenant is the global set; anything else
 * belongs to its tenant and is never borrowed across tenants.
