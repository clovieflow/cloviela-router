/**
 * Tokens already recorded for the current daily and monthly admission buckets.
 *
 * The admission counters themselves are transient (Redis keys with a bucket
 * TTL), so when an operator adds a limit to a key that has already spent in the
 * current bucket, there is no counter to read. This reads the durable record —
 * telemetry — instead, which is what the bucket would have contained had the
 * limit existed all along.
 *
 * Buckets are UTC, matching `admission.ts` (`toISOString().slice(0, 10)` /
 * `slice(0, 7)`), so a seeded counter lines up with the one the reserve script
 * would have written.
 *
 * A share template's recipients admit under the parent id, and their spend is
 * attributed to their own child row, so the family is summed — otherwise
 * seeding a template would miss everything its recipients already used.
